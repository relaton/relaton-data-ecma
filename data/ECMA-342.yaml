    The RapidIO™ architecture was developed to address the need for a high-performance low pin count packet-switched system level interconnect to be used in a variety of applications as an open standard.
    The architecture is targeted toward networking, telecom, and high performance embedded applications. It is intended primarily as an intra-system interface, allowing chip-to-chip and board-to-board communications at Gigabyte per second performance levels. It provides a rich variety of features including high data bandwidth, low-latency capability and support for high-performance I/O devices, as well as providing globally shared memory, message passing, and software managed programming models. In its simplest form, the interface can be implemented in a FPGA end point. The interconnect defines a protocol independent of a physical implementation. The physical features of an implementation utilizing the interconnect are defined by the requirements of the implementation, such as I/O signaling levels, interconnect topology, physical layer protocol, error detection, and so forth. The architecture is intended and partitioned to allow adaptation to a multitude of applications.
