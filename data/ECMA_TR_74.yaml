    The EMC Directive[1] and the European Commission Guidelines[2] apply to a great diversity of equipment and are therefore written in general terms. Interpretation of how the requirements apply to ITE is often difficult and can lead to widely differing practices between manufacturers. This Guide is intended to supplement the European Commission Guidelines and clarify their application to ITE.
    It represents the interpretations and recommendations agreed by the Ecma member companies, and is not intended in any way to be legal advice. Ecma accepts no responsibility for any consequences a manufacturer may face as a result of following these recommendations.
