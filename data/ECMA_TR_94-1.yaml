    This Technical Report addresses the technical assessment of Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) based on CENELEC standard EN 50371 for low power emitting devices with a maximum total of 20 mW average emitted power.
    Three different EMC compliance measurements are the basis for the assessment for each of these frequency ranges:
    a) 10 MHz – 30 MHz;
    b) 30 MHz – 1 GHz;
    c) 1 GHz.
