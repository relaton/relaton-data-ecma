    This Standard specifies service description and control aspects of the broadband connection oriented bearer services which may be provided by Broadband Private Integrated Services Networks (B-PISNs).
    One of the purposes of the service specification for broadband connection oriented bearer services is to guide and constrain the work on signalling protocols.
    Therefore, this Standard is concerned mainly with the control aspects of services.
    Change of traffic characteristics during a call is outside the scope of this Standard.
    Charging considerations are outside the scope of this Standard.
