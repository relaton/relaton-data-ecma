abstract:
- content: This Ecma Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics
    of a 12,7 mm wide, 18-track magnetic tape cartridge to enable interchangeability
    of such cartridges. It also specifies the quality of the recorded signals, the
    format and the recording method thus allowing, together with Standard ECMA-13
    for Magnetic Tape Labelling, full data interchange by means of such magnetic tape
    cartridges.
