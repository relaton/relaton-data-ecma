    This Standard specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Transit Counter additional network feature (ANF-TC) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated Services Network Exchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Broadband Private Integrated Services Network (B-PISN).
    ANF-TC is a feature that limits the number of Transit PINXs that a call/connection setup request may be routed through e.g., to protect the network against indefinite looping.
    The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.
    Service specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in CCITT Rec. I.130. This Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ECMA-224.
    The signalling protocol for ANF-TC operates in association with the signalling protocols for basic call/connection control (as specified in ISO/IEC 13247) and call independent (connection oriented) signalling connections (as specified in ECMA-254).
    This Standard is applicable to PINXs that can interconnect to form a PISN.
    The protocol defined in this Standard forms part of the B-QSIG protocol.
