    This Standard specifies the signalling ATM adaptation layer (SAAL) protocol used at the interface between Broadband PINXs and between Broadband PISNs within the framework of the B-QSIG signalling system protocol family. The B-QSIG SAAL uses the functions provided by the ATM layer, and provides the services required by the B-QSIG Layer 3 signalling protocols.
    The protocol defined in this Standard forms part of the B-QSIG protocol.
