    This Standard defines the signalling protocol for the purpose of basic call/connection control at the Q-reference point between Private Integrated Services Network Exchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Broadband Private Integrated Services Network (B-PISN) employing Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). This Standard is part of the B-QSIG signalling system.
    The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.
    This Standard is an application of the signalling protocol that forms part of the ATM Forum’s PNNI 1.0 specification, which in turn is based on ITU-T Recommendation Q.2931, including the provisions for symmetrical operation described in annex H of recommendation Q.2931. Technical differences compared with the signalling protocol specified in PNNI 1.0 are summarised in annex J. Guidelines for interworking between a network employing the signalling protocol specified in this Standard and a network employing the ATM Forum’s PNNI 1.0 specification are given in annex L.
    This Standard is applicable to PINXs which interconnect to form a B-PISN using static hop-by-hop routeing. It therefore complements the ATM Forum’s PNNI 1.0 specification, which is applicable to networks that employ dynamic source routeing.
    The basic capabilities supported by the protocol specified in this Standard are listed below and described in more detail in annex F:
    The protocol defined in this Standard forms part of the B-QSIG protocol.
