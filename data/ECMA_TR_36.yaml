abstract:
- content: This Technical Report gives guidance on magnetic tape parameters that are
    considered important to ensure continued good performance of tape systems. When
    preparing purchasing specifications, these parameters should be considered in
    addition to parameters included in the interchange Standards as they constitute
    an important part in the description of the product. Whereas this report does
    not develop a model for a purchasing specification, it does provide a technical
    presentation of several parameters which should be included.
