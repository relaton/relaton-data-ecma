    This Profile Standard specifies the combination of base standards, together with the selection of appropriate options and parameter values, necessary to specify how QSIG / PSS1 can be used to provide digital signalling capabilities between Private Integrated services Networks eXchange (PINX) in an Air Traffic Services (ATS) PISN.
    This Standard defines:
    This Standard states requirements upon implementations in order to achieve interoperability between equipment in ATS PISNs.
    NOTE â€“ Implementation of this Standard does not preclude a manufacturer from offering other means of interconnection.
    This Standard does not specify requirements related to interworking between QSIG and other signalling systems used in ATS PISNs.
