    This Ecma Standard specifies the characteristics of 120 mm Optical Disk Cartridges (ODCs) with a capacity of 650 Mbytes using Phase Change PD format. The present Ecma Standard specifies two related, but different implementations of such cartridges, viz.
    Type R/W
    Provides for data to be written, read and overwritten many times over the whole recording surface of the disk using the phase change recording and read-out method.
    Type WORM
    Provides for data to be written once and read many times over the whole recording surface of the disk using the phase change recording and read-out method.
    Type R/W and Type WORM are also referred to as “rewritable” and “write-once” respectively.
    This Ecma Standard specifies:
    This Ecma Standard provides for interchange between optical disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.
