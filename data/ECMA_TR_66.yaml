    This Technical Report provides a mapping of the PCTE, Standard ECMA-149 relative to the Reference Model (RM) for Frameworks of Software Engineering Environments.
    A mapping of PCTE should include a description of the SEE components defined in PCTE using the common reference terms and structures provided by the RM. In this way it will provide a basis for comparing components of PCTE with other SEE components and related standards.
    The mapping consists of a section for each of the services described in the RM which are covered by PCTE. The main part of this document is structured in a way corresponding to the RM in order to facilitate comparisons and references to either other mappings, or with the RM document itself.
