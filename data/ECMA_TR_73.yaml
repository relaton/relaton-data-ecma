    The purpose of this Technical Report is to investigate the interoperability of H.323 and B-ISDN signalling environments with a view to identifying possible standardization activities in this area.
    The following aspects of interoperability are investigated:
    For each of the above, due consideration is given to the following: addressing impact (including use of IP addressing); conferencing models; T.120 data impact; basic call procedures; generic functional procedures (GFP) and supplementary services; end-to-end resource and session level protocols.
    Possible future standardization activities resulting from this Technical Report will include H.323 work items as well as B-ISDN signalling work items.
