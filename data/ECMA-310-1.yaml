    This Standard specifies the supplementary service Simple Dialog (SS-SD), which is applicable to various basic services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). Basic services are specified in ECMA-142.
    Supplementary service SD enables a user to communicate with another user or application by the exchange of keypad and display information transparently over a PISN.
    Service specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387. This Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of SS-SD. The stage 1 specification (clause 6) specifies the supplementary service as seen by users of PISNs. The stage 2 specification (clause 7) specifies the functional entities involved in the supplementary service and the information flows between them.
