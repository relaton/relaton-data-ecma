    ECMA-340, ISO/IEC 14443 and ISO/IEC 15693 standards specify the radio frequency signal interface, initialization, anti-collision and protocols for wireless interconnection of closely coupled devices and access to contactless integrated circuit cards operating at 13,56 MHz.
    This Standard specifies the communication mode selection mechanism, designed not to disturb any ongoing communication at 13,56 MHz, for devices implementing ECMA-340, ISO/IEC 14443 or ISO/IEC 15693. This Standard requires implementations to enter the selected communication mode as specified in the respective standard. The communication mode specifications, however, are outside the scope of this NFCIP-2 Standard.
