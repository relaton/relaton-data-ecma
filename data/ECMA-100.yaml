    This Ecma Standard specifies the characteristics of 90 mm flexible disk cartridges recorded at 7 958 ftprad using modified frequency modulation recording, on 80 tracks on each side â€“ ISO Type 301.
    It specifies the mechanical, physical and magnetic characteristics of the cartridge, so as to provide physical interchangeability between data processing systems.
    It also specifies the method of recording, the quality of the recorded signals, the track layout and the track format.
    Together with the labelling scheme of Standard ECMA-107, this Standard provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.
