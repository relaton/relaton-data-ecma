    This Standard specifies the message contents and the cryptographic methods for PIDÂ 01.
    This Standard specifies cryptographic mechanisms that use the Elliptic Curves Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) protocol for key agreement and the AES algorithm for data encryption and integrity.
    The mechanisms are for use with the Services and Protocol specified in ECMA-385.
    This Standard was originally developed by TC47. The work of TC47 has been transferred to TC51-TG1.
