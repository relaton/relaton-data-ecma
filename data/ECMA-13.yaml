    This Ecma Standard specifies the file structure and the labelling of magnetic tapes for the interchange of information between users of information processing systems.
    This Ecma Standard specifies the volume and file structure, and the basic characteristics of the blocks containing the records constituting the file. It also specifies the recorded labels to identify files, file sections and volume of magnetic tapes. It also specifies four nested levels of interchange.
    Furthermore, this Ecma Standard specifies requirements for the processes which are provided within information processing systems, to enable information to be interchanged between different systems, utilizing recorded magnetic tape as the medium of interchange. For this purpose it specifies the functions to be provided within systems which are intended to originate or receive magnetic tape volumes which conform to this Ecma Standard.
