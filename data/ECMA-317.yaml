    This Ecma Standard specifies the characteristics of a 300 mm optical disk cartridge (ODC) of Type WORM (Write Once Read Many) using irreversible effects, with a capacity of 30 Gbytes. This WORM ODCâ€™s uses writing effects that are inherently irreversible. Written marks cannot be erased and attempted modofications of the written marks are detectable.
    This Ecma Standard specifies:
    This Ecma Standard provides for interchange between optical disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.
