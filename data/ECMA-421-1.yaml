    This Ecma standard specifies the quality discrimination method of optical disks and operating method of storage systems for long-term digital data preservation using optical disk and optical disk drives (hereinafter referred to as drive).
    It is applicable to recordable (write-once) optical disks which can prevent physical overwriting and deletion by erroneous or intentional operation when giving greater importance to evidence, and to read-only (ROM) optical disks.
    It enables users to build data storage systems that use the optical disks for information storage. Data quality recorded on a high quality recordable optical disk which has a sufficient lifetime, and on a read-only optical disk can be confirmed by the results of the initial quality test. In addition, the degree of deterioration of the data quality recorded on the optical disk (data retrievability) can be continuously monitored by the periodic quality test.
    Manufacturers will be able to supply optical disks and drives suitable for building data storage systems that use recordable optical disks and read-only optical disks for long-term data preservation based on this Ecma standard.
    This Ecma standard specifies:
    ―  Combination of recordable optical disks and drives used for long-term data preservation;
    ―  Quality discrimination criteria of recordable optical disks and operation method of long-term storage systems;
    ―  Quality tests of read-only optical disks and operation method of long-term storage systems;
    ―  Quality discrimination criteria adopting the defect management on BD recordable disk.
