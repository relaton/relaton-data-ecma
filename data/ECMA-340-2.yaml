    This Standard defines:
    This document specifies:
    Information interchange between systems is based on agreement between the interchange parties upon the interchange codes and the data structure.
    This 4th edition fully matches ISO/IEC 18092.
    ECMA-356 “NFCIP-1 – RF Interface Test Methods”, and ECMA-362 “NFCIP-1 – Protocol Test Methods” specify tests for ECMA-340.
    ECMA-373 specifies the two-wire interface between a Transceiver and a Front-end.
    This Standard was originally developed by TC47. The work of TC47 has been transferred to TC51-TG1.
