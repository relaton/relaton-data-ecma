    This Standard specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Single Step Call Transfer supplementary service (SS-SSCT) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated Network services eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).
    SS-SSCT is a supplementary service which enables a user, user A, to transform an existing call between user A and user B into a new call between user B and a user C whereby user A does not have a call established with user C prior to call transfer.
    The Q reference point is defined in ECMA-133.
    Service specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. This Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ECMA-299.
    The signalling protocol for SS-SSCT operates on top of the signalling protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as specified in ECMA-143, and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified in ECMA-156.
    This Standard also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point between Single Step Call Transfer and other supplementary services and ANFs.
    This Standard is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN.
    The protocol defined in this Standard forms part of the PSS1 protocol (informally known as QSIG).
