    This Ecma Standard defines four 8-bit coded graphic character sets identified as Latin Alphabets No 1 to No 4, and specifies the coded representation of each character by means of a single 8-bit byte.
    Characters common to two or more sets are allocated to the same code position. None of these characters are “non-spacing”.
    The use of control functions, such as BACKSPACE or CARRIAGE RETURN for the coded representation of composite characters is prohibited by this Standard.
