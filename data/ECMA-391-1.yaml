    This Ecma Standard specifies modulation schemes, codings, data rates, and frame formats of the RF interface, as well as initialization schemes and conditions required for data collision control during initialization.
    Furthermore, this Ecma Standard specifies a transport protocol including protocol activation and data exchange methods.
    This Standard was originally developed by TC47. The work of TC47 has been transferred to TC51-TG1.
