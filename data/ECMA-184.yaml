    This Ecma Standard specifies the characteristics of 130 mm Optical Disk Cartridges (ODC) with a capacity of 1,3 Gbytes per cartridge. The Standard specifies four related, but different implementations of such cartridges, viz.
    Type R/W
    Provides for data to be written, read, and erased many times over the whole of both recording surfaces of the disk using the thermo-magnetic and magneto-optical effects.
    Type P-ROM
    Provides for a part of both disk surfaces to be pre-recorded and reproduced by stamping or other means. This part of the disk is read without recourse to the magneto-optical effect. All parts which are not pre-recorded, provide for data to meet the requirements of Type R/W.
    Type O-ROM
    Provides for the whole of both disk surfaces to be pre-recorded and reproduced by stamping or other means. This type of disk is read without recourse to the magneto-optical effect.
    Type WO
    Provides write once, read multiple functionality on both disk surfaces using the thermo-magnetic and magneto-optical effects.
    The Ecma Standard specifies
    This Ecma Standard provides for interchange between optical disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.
