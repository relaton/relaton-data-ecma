- content: |-
    This Ecma Standard specifies a reference configuration (RC) for private integrated services network exchanges (PINXs) for their interconnection to form private integrated services networks (PISNs). The configuration is not intended to require any specific implementation of a PINX, but only to provide guidance for the specification of PINX capabilities.
    This RC is sufficient to support ISDN-like applications. It can be extended to also support non-ISDN-like applications.
    This RC describes a conceptual PINX. By combining multiple PINXs to a private integrated services network the RC becomes applicable to a PISN.
