    This Standard specifies the signalling protocol for the support of clock synchronization (SYNC-SIG) between Private Integrated Services Network Exchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).
    This protocol supports the synchronization of a PISN using the different sources of clocks available to each PINX. The protocol is based on the method of synchronization described in annex F of the International StandardÂ ISO/IEC 11573.
    This Standard is applicable to PINXs which can be interconnected to form a PISN.
