    This Ecma Technical Report is one of a series of publications that provides an overview of IP-based enterprise communication involving Corporate telecommunication Networks (CNs) (also known as enterprise networks) and in particular Next Generation Corporate Networks (NGCN).
    The series particularly focuses on session level communication based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (IETF RFC 3261), with an emphasis on inter-domain communication. This includes communication between parts of the same enterprise (on dedicated infrastructures and/or hosted), between enterprises and between enterprises and public networks. Particular consideration is given to Next Generation Networks (NGN) as public networks and as providers of hosted enterprise capabilities. Key technical issues are investigated, current standardisation work and gaps in this area are identified, and a number of requirements are stated. Among other uses, this series of publications can act as a reference for other standardisation bodies working in this field, including ETSI TISPAN, 3GPP, IETF and ITU T.
    This particular Technical Report discusses session level user identification and routing. It uses terminology and concepts developed in TR/NGCN-General (ECMA TR/95). It identifies a number of requirements impacting NGN standardisation and concerning deployment of enterprise networks.
    The scope of this Technical Report is limited to communications with a real-time element, including but not limited to voice, video, real-time text and instant messaging.
