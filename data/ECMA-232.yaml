    This Profile Standard specifies the combination of base standards, together with the selection of appropriate options and parameter values, necessary to interface a Radio Paging Equipment, RPE, to a PINX.
    The standard provides for two methods of connection of an RPE to a PINX. With the first method, the RPE is connected in a similar manner to a TE connected at the S reference point using an ISDN basic access interface at layer 1. With the second method the RPE is connected in a similar manner to another PINX connected at the C reference point using an ISDN basic access interface or a primary rate interface at layer 1. In this case static mapping is employed between the C reference point and the Q reference point. The C, Q and S reference points are defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.
    This Standard states requirements upon implementations to achieve interoperability between equipment on each side of the RPE/PINX interface.
    NOTE â€“ Implementation of one or more profiles from this Standard does not preclude a manufacturer from offering other means of interconnection.
