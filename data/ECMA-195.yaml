    This Ecma Standard specifies the characteristics of a series of related 130 mm optical disk cartridges (ODCs) by using a number of Type designations. The two sides of the disk, called Side A and Side B, with each a nominal storage capacity of 1 Gigabyte are given specific Type designations. Thus, Side A and Side B may be different types.
    The suffix â€“ R, which may be used for Side B only, indicates that the tracks of Side B spiral in the opposite direction to those on Side A. Such ODCs facilitate simultaneous access to both sides of the disk by a dual optical system.
    The 20 combinations of Types allowed by this Ecma Standard for the two sides of disks are specified in this Standard.
    In addition, for each Type, this Ecma Standard provides for 512-byte and 1 024-byte sector sizes. All sectors of an ODC are the same size.
    This Ecma Standard specifies
    This Ecma Standard provides for interchange between optical disk drives. Together with a Standard for volume and file structure it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.
