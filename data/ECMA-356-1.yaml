    This Standard specifies RF-test methods for NFCIP-1 devices with antennas fitting within the rectangular area of 50 mm by 40 mm. This Ecma Standard is the companion of ECMA-362, both specify tests for ECMA-340 (NFCIP-1).
    This Standard was originally developed by TC47. The work of TC47 was transferred to TC51-TG1.
