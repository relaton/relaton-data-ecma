    This Ecma Standard specifies the close capacitive coupling communication physical layer (CCCC PHY) for full duplex and broadcast communication in time slots on frequency division multiplex channels.
    This Standard was originally developed by TC47. The work of TC47 has been transferred to TC51-TG1.
