    This Standard specifies the message contents and the cryptographic mechanisms for PID 03.
    This Standard specifies key agreement and confirmation mechanisms providing mutual authentication, using asymmetric cryptography, and the transport protocol requirements for the exchange between Sender and TTP.
    This Standard was originally developed by TC47. The work of TC47 has been transferred to TC51-TG1.
