    This Ecma Standard specifies the characteristics of 90 mm Optical Disk Cartridges, (ODCs) with a capacity of 385 Mbytes per cartridge. The Standard specifies one type of such cartridge, viz.
    Type R/W
    Provides for data to be written, read and erased many times over the whole of the recording surface of the disk using the thermo-magnetic and magneto-optical effects.
    This Ecma Standard specifies:
    This Ecma Standard provides for media interchange between optical disk drives. Together with a Standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.
