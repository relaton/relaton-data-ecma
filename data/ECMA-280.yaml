    This Ecma Standard specifies the characteristics of a 130 mm optical disk cartridge (ODC) of Type WORM (Write Once Read Many) with a capacity of 5,2 Gbytes. Type WORM ODCs use writing effects that are inherently irreversible. Written marks cannot be erased and attempted modification of the written marks are detectable.
    This Ecma Standard specifies
    This Ecma Standard provides for interchange between optical disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.
