    This Ecma standard specifies a lossless compression algorithm to reduce the number of bytes required to represent data. The algorithm is known as Adaptive Lossless Data Compression algorithm (ALDC). The numerical identifiers according to ISO/IEC 11576 allocated to this algorithm are:
    ALDC 512-Byte History Buffer: 3
    ALDC 1024-Byte History Buffer: 4
    ALDC 2048-Byte History Buffer: 5
