    This Standard specifies the supplementary services Calling Name Identification Presentation (SS-CNIP), Connected Name Identification Presentation (SS-CONP) and Calling/Connected Name Identification Restriction (SS-CNIR), which are applicable to various basic services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). Basic services are specified in ECMA-142.
    Calling Name Identification Presentation (CNIP) is a supplementary service which is offered to the called user and which provides the name of the calling user (calling party name) to the called user.
    Connected Name Identification Presentation (CONP) is a supplementary service which is offered to the calling user and which provides to the calling user the following:
    Calling/Connected Name Identification Restriction (CNIR) is a supplementary service which is offered to a user to restrict presentation of that user’s name to another user.
    Service specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387.
    This Standard contains the stage 1 and 2 specifications of the Name Identification supplementary services. The stage 1 specifications (clauses 6, 7 and 8) specify the supplementary services as seen by users of PISNs. The stage 2 specifications (clauses 9, 10 and 11) identify the functional entities involved in the supplementary services and the information flows between them.
