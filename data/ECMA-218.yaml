    This Standard specifies application protocol data units (APDUs) for the services described in Standard ECMA-217, Services for Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA) Phase II. The field of application of this Standard is the interconnection of switches and computers in a private telecommunications environment.
    Phase II of CSTA extends the range of features offered by CSTA Phase I.
    Section II (clause 5 to clause 7 inclusive) describes the concepts underlying the Remote Operations model, notation and service.
    Section III (clause 8 to clause 19 inclusive) contains CSTA-specific protocol details and forms the main part of this Standard.
    Further information on CSTA is also available.
