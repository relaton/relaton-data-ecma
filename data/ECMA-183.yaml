    This Ecma Standard specifies the characteristics of 130 mm optical disk cartridges (ODCs) with a capacity of 1 Gigabyte per cartridge. The standard specifies two related, but different implementations of such cartridges:
    Type R/W
    Provides for data to be written, read and erased many times over the whole of both recording surfaces of the disk using the thermo-magnetic and magneto-optical effects.
    Type WO
    Provides write once, read multiple functionality on both disk surfaces using the thermo-magnetic and magneto-optical effects.
    This Ecma Standard specifies:
    This Ecma Standard provides for interchange between optical disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems. Interchange involves the ability to write, read and erase data without introducing any error.
