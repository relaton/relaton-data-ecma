    This Technical Report identifies key use cases for communication with or between IP-based Next Generation Corporate Networks (NGCN) involving public next generation networks (NGN), analyses these use cases in terms of available or planned standardised technology and identifies requirements that will have to be met.
    This Technical Report investigates configurations involving NGCNs and NGNs and their interoperating requirements. Non-IP-based interoperation, i.e. using circuit-switched technology, between NGCNs and NGNs is outside the scope of this Technical Report.
    This Technical Report does not discriminate between wireless and wired access technology.
    All mobility aspects are outside the scope of this Technical Report. They are covered by a companion Technical ReportÂ ECMA TR/92.
    Application considerations such as IP Centrex and CSTA (Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications) are outside the scope of this Technical Report.
