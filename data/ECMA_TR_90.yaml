    This Technical Report describes amendments and additions to the 2nd edition of ECMA-348 to be effectuated when the WS-Addressing and WS-Eventing specifications become stabilised.
    ECMA-348 2nd edition specifies a Web service interface for CSTA (ECMA-269) in Web Services Description Language (WSDL) version 1.1. It provides WSDL definitions for solicit-response and notification operations, referred in this Technical Report as outbound operations. These operations are used in ECMA-348 to convey events, some negative responses and computing function services. However, WSDL 1.1 does not specify concrete bindings for those outbound operations.
    In particular, WSDL 1.1 does not provide a mechanism for transmitting events, e.g. specifying where the switching function should send CSTA events. This Technical Report proposes to amend ECMA-348 to establish an event channel and event-sink interface using WS-Addressing and WS-Eventing.
    This Technical Report proposes to add a Computing Function WSDL interface for proper support of the Computing Function Services of ECMA-348.
    CSTA also requires an application context before any services or events can be exchanged, to that end, this Technical Report proposes that the next edition of ECMA-348 uses WS-Session (ECMA-366) Services.
