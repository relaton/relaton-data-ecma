    This Standard specifies application protocol data units (APDUs) for the services described in Standard ECMA-179, Services for Computer-Supported Telecommunications Applications. The field of application of this Standard is the interconnection of switches and computers in a private telecommunications environment.
    Section 2 (clause 5 to clause 7 inclusive) describes the concepts underlying the Remote Operations model, notation and service. Section 3 (clause 8 to clause 16 inclusive) contains CSTA-specific protocol details and forms the main body of this Standard.
    Further information on the CSTA topic is also available.
