    This Ecma Technical Report specifies a method to generate iso-acoustic fan curves for small air-moving devices, with or without the presence of a fixture to provide a specific inlet condition to the unit under test. A fixture to provide inlet restriction applicable to blowers used in cooling of notebook computers is also described.
    It is assumed that users are familiar with aerodynamic fan performance measurements and the use of the acoustic fan plenum to measure sound power of a fan under load.
