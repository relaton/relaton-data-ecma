    This Ecma Standard defines a set of 185 graphic characters identified as Latin/Greek Alphabet, and specifies the coded representation of each of these characters by means of a single 8-bit byte. None of these characters are “non-spacing”.
    The use of control functions, such as BACKSPACE or CARRIAGE RETURN for the coded representation of composite characters is prohibited by this Standard.
