    This Standard specifies environmental attributes and measurement methods for ICT and CE products according to known regulations, standards, guidelines and currently accepted practices. The Standard is also applicable to products used as subassemblies, components, accessories and/or optional parts.
    The standard addresses company programs and product related attributes, however not manufacturing processes and logistic aspects. Although the declaration templates as defined in annexes A, B1 and B2 are optimized for application in the European Union, this Standard is intended for global use. Additional annexes may be added for other regions. The annexes cover the following items:
    Company environmental profile (Annex A)
    The company environmental profile is split into legal and market requirements such as:
    Product environmental attributes (Annex B1 and B2, corrected in December 2019)
    The Product environmental attributes are split into legal and market requirements on:
    The attributes are listed without differentiation between products categories. Not all attributes do necessarily apply to each product category.
    Based on frequently asked questions from customers, some product attributes such as safety, and ergonomics have been included although they are not considered environmental matters.
    Should you have questions on usage of ECMA-370, or wish to send a comment (e.g., in case mandatory information might be missing or seems to be out of date), please use the Ecma International contact page.
    For certain complex attributes, new guidance documents have been developed with two purposes, firstly to guide the user of the declaration to understand the attribute, ensure that the correct test methods are used and that correct information is entered in the declaration. The second aim is to ensure that the reader of the declaration understands the information and that it’s used correctly when comparing product attributes. Guidance documents are currently available for: acoustic noise, energy efficiency, chemical emissions, chemical substances, but others can be added in the future.
    The guidance documents are linked from the declarations to: www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-370.htm
    A “change history” webpage is regularly updated.
    NOTE
    The Guidance documents are not part of the ECMA-370 Standard and can be amended without any prior notification.
