abstract:
- content: This Ecma Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics
    of a 12,7 mm wide, 448-track magnetic tape cartridge, to enable physical interchangeability
    of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of the recorded
    signals, a format – called Super Digital Linear Tape 1 (SDLT 1) – and a recording
    method, thereby allowing data interchange between drives. Together with a labelling
    standard, for instance Standard ECMA-13 for Magnetic Tape Labelling, it allows
    full data interchange by means of such magnetic tape cartridges.
