    This Standard specifies the signalling protocol for the support of name identification supplementary services at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). The name identification supplementary services are Calling Name Identification Presentation (SS-CNIP) and Connected Name Identification Presentation (SS-CONP).
    Calling Name Identification Presentation (CNIP) is a supplementary service which is offered to the called user and which provides the name of the calling user (calling party name) to the called user.
    Connected Name Identification Presentation (CONP) is a supplementary service which is offered to the calling user and which provides to the calling user the following:
    The supplementary service Calling/connected Name Identification Restriction (CNIR) has no impact on the signalling at Q reference point.
    Provision of a userâ€™s name to the PISN is outside the scope of this Standard.
    The Q reference point is defined in ECMA-133.
    Service specifications are produced in three stages according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. This Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ECMA-163.
    The signalling protocol for SS-CNIP and SS-CONP operates on top of the signalling protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as specified in ECMA-143, and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified in ECMA-165.
    This Standard also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at Q reference point between name identification supplementary services and other supplementary services and ANFs.
    This Standard is applicable to PINXs which can be interconnected to form a PISN.
    The protocol defined in this Standard forms part of the PSS1 protocol (informally known as QSIG).
