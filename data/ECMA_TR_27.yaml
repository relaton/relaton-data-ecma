- content: This Ecma Technical Report specifies a method for the prediction of installation
    noise levels. This method takes into account the acoustical properties of the
    room in which computer and business equipment is installed, the location(s) of
    the noise emitting equipment and their noise emission level(s), determined in
    accordance with StandardÂ ECMA-74, and the locations(s) of interest.
