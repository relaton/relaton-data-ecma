    This Standard defines the signalling protocol for the purpose of bearer control at the Q-reference point between Private Integrated Services Network Exchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Broadband Private Integrated Services Network (B-PISN) employing Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). This Standard is part of the B-QSIG signalling system.
    This Standard specifies the essential features, procedures, and messages required for establishing, maintaining and clearing of bearer connections to point-to-point multiconnection calls at the B-QSIG interface in a functionally separated call and bearer control environment. Bearers are controlled independently by means of a separated call control protocol. The separated call control protocol is assumed to be that specified in ECMA-294.
    This Standard is applicable to PINXs that support separated call and bearer control protocol at the Q reference point. The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.
    The protocol defined in this Standard forms part of the B-QSIG protocol.
