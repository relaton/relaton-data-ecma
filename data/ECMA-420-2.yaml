    This Ecma standard specifies the device interface information and requirements for high-speed image retrieval and collation using holographic optical correlation based on shift-multiplex recording of coaxial holography.
    This standard specifies:
    This standard is mainly used in professional fields, especially high-speed movie picture retrieval system to detect illegal and/or specific pictures.
