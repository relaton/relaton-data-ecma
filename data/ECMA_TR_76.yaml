    A Private Integrated Service Network (PISN) is a network comprising either one PINX or more than one PINX interconnected by Inter-PINX connections. This Technical Report is concerned with inter-PINX connections (IPC) that are provided by Intervening Networks (IVN), and the way in which these are handled by PINXs to provide a platform for inter-PINX communication. Different types of IVNs can be used to provide IPCs, in accordance with the scenarios indicated in ISO/IEC 11579-1. These are Overlay Scenarios in that they enable the services of the PISN to operate transparently across an IVN.
    Connected PINXs need to co-ordinate their use of IVNs, and appropriate standardisation is needed to allow networks to be created employing PINXs and IVNs from multiple vendors. The following points need to be considered:
    The aim of this Technical Report is to identify:
