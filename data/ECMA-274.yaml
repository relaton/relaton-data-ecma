    This Ecma Standard specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics of 120 mm rewritable optical disks with capacities of 3,0 Gbytes and 6,0 Gbytes. It specifies the quality of the recorded and unrecorded signals, the format of the data and the recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange by means of such disks. The data can be written, read and overwritten many times using the phase change method. These disks are identified as +RW.
    This Ecma Standard specifies
    This Ecma Standard provides for the interchange of disks between optical disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.
