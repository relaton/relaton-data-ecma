    This Standard specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the additional network feature Call Interception (ANF-CINT) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINX) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).
    ANF-CINT is an additional network feature which enables calls that cannot be completed due to certain conditions to be redirected to a predetermined intercepted-to user.
    The Q reference point is defined in ECMA-133.
    Service specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. This Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ECMA-220.
    The signalling protocol for ANF-CINT operates on top of the signalling protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as specified in ECMA-143, and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified in ECMA-165.
    This Standard also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point between ANF-CINT and other supplementary services and ANFs.
    NOTE – Additional interactions that have no impact on the signalling protocol at the Q reference point can be found in the relevant stage 1 specifications.
    This Standard is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN.
    The protocol defined in this Standard forms part of the PSS1 protocol (informally known as QSIG).
