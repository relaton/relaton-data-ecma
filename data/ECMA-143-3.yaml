    This Standard defines the signalling procedures and protocol for the purpose of circuit-switched Call Control at the Q-reference point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).
    The Q reference point is defined in ECMA-133.
    This Standard is based upon that described in Recommendation Q.931, including the provisions for symmetrical operation described in annex D of that recommendation.
    Service specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. This Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ECMA-142, ECMA-148 and ISO/IEC 11584.
    This Standard is applicable to PINXs which interconnect to form a PISN.
