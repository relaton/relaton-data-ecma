    This Standard specifies application protocol data units (APDUs) for the services described in ECMA-269.
    Clause 5 to clause 7 inclusive describes the concepts underlying the Remote Operations model, notation and service.
    Clause 8 to clause 27 inclusive contains CSTA-specific protocol details and forms the main part of this Standard.
    The protocol in this Standard operates in the context of an application association.
    This Standard inherits LocationInfo from ECMA-269. Since most of the ASN.1 compilers cannot resolve the type “any”, as used in ECMA-323 for LocationInfo, a distinct implementation from the required RFC 4119 has been made.
    Further information on the CSTA topic is also available.
    The file “ECMA-285, 4th edition, December 2011, source_files.zip” contains the following files:
    Note: depending upon the compiler used, two duplicate tags can be expected (Reject, ACSEUserInformationForCSTA). These are normal and should not affect the compiled output.
