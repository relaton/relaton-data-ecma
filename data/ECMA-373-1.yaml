    This Ecma Standard specifies the digital wire interface between a Transceiver and a Front-end. The specification includes the signal wires, binary signals, the state diagrams and the bit encodings for three data rates. See also companion Front-end configuration (NFC-FEC) standard.
    This Standard was originally developed by TC47. The work of TC47 was transferred to TC51-TG1.
