    This Standard specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Call Identification and Call Linkage additional network feature (ANF-CIDL) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated Network services eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).
    ANF-CIDL is an additional network feature which allows the assignment of a Global Call Identification (GID) to identify a call end-to-end over the call route (i.e. between the two end PINXs). As an option, a Thread Identification (TID) may be assigned to different calls which are logically linked together due to the operation of other supplementary services and/or ANFs. Additionally a Leg Identification (LID) may be assigned, to identify the different legs of a call.
    NOTE 1 â€“ This ANF has been developed to support the use of CSTA (ECMA-269) in a networked environment, i.e. in a PISN. Use of this ANF for other applications is not precluded.
    The Q reference point is defined in ECMA-133.
    Supplementary Service specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. This Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ECMA-313.
    The signalling protocol for ANF-CIDL operates on top of the signalling protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as specified in ECMA-143, and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified in ECMA-165.
    This Standard also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point between Call Identification and Call Linkage and other supplementary services and ANFs.
    This Standard is applicable to PINXs which can be interconnected to form a PISN.
    The protocol defined in this Standard forms part of the PSS1 protocol (informally known as QSIG).
