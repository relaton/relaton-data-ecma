- content: |-
    This Ecma standard specifies the device interface information and requirements for high-speed image retrieval and collation using holographic optical correlation based on shift-multiplex recording of coaxial holography.
    This standard specifies:
    This standard is mainly used for professional field such as high-speed illegal movie picture retrieval systems, video and picture hosting web sites, data centres and so on.
