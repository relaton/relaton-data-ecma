    This Standard specifies the NFC-SEC secure channel and shared secret services for NFCIP-1 and the PDUs and protocol for those services.
    The NFC-SEC cryptography standards identified in the PID registry complement and use the services and protocol specified in this Standard.
    This Standard was originally developed by TC47. The work of TC47 has been transferred to TC51-TG1.
