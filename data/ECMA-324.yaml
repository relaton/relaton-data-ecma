    This Standard specifies the Short Message Service (SMS).
    SMS enables a user to send and receive Short Messages (SMs) to and from another user.
    NOTE 1 – This service is based on GSM 03.40. The Service Centre functionality described in this Standard is equal to the functionality of a Service Centre in GSM 03.40. Thus, for interoperability with a GSM network, it is only necessary to implement a QSIG interface and some interworking in the Service Centre in order to use it in the herein described network.
    NOTE 2 – The Short Message Service is a special kind of basic service but is described in this document in the style of a supplementary service.
    Supplementary service specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387. This Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of SMS. The stage 1 specification (clause 6) specifies the service as seen by users of PISNs. The stage 2 specification (clause 7) identifies the functional entities involved in the service and the information flows between them.
