    This Ecma Standard specifies the characteristics of 90 mm Optical Disk Cartridges (ODC) with a capacity of 230 Mbytes per Cartridge. The Standard specifies three related, but different implementations of such cartridges, viz.
    Type R/W
    Provides for data to be written, read and erased many times over the whole recording surface of the disk using the thermo-magnetic and magneto-optical effects.
    Type P-ROM
    Provides for a part of the disk surface to be embossed by stamping or other means. This part of the disk is read without recourse to the magneto-optical effect. All parts which are not embossed provide for data to meet the requirements of Type R/W.
    Type O-ROM
    Provides for the whole of the disk surface to be embossed and reproduced by stamping or other means. This type of disk is read without recourse to the magneto-optical effect.
    Type R/W, Type P-ROM and Type O-ROM are also referred to as “fully rewritable”, “partially embossed” and “fully embossed”, respectively.
    This Ecma Standard specifies
    This Ecma Standard provides for interchange between optical disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.
