    This Ecma Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of an 8 mm wide magnetic tape cartridge to enable interchangeability of such cartridges.
    It also provides a format and recording method, thus allowing, together with Standard ECMA-13 for Magnetic Tape Labelling, full data interchange by means of such magnetic tape cartridges.
