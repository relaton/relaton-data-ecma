    This Ecma Technical Report describes a digital shaped pink noise file representative of speech in two main characteristics, namely the spectrum and the crest factor. The spectrum is defined in third-octave band levels relative to pink noise up to the 8 kHz band, which provides a sufficient bandwidth for speech. The crest factor is defined at a 30 second time scale. The recording level of the file is not specified, and should be adjusted to match the amplitude, at the output of the headphone, of a typical audiobook or podcast when played on the device under test.
    This file is not meant to replace the existing file defined in EN 50332-1 for hearing safety.
