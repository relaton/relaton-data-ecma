abstract:
- content: This Ecma Standard specifies an algorithm for the reduction of the number
    of bits required to represent information. This process is known as Data Compression.
    The algorithm uses binary arithmetic coding. The algorithm provides lossless compression
    and is intended for use in information interchange.
