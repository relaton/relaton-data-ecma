    This Ecma Standard specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics of an 80 mm and a 120 mm DVD – Recordable disk to enable the interchange of such disks. It specifies the quality of the pre-recorded, unrecorded and the recorded signals, the format of the data, the format of the information zone, the format of the unrecorded zone, and the recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange by means of such disks.
