    This Standard specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Private User Mobility call handling additional network features (ANF-PUMI and ANF-PUMO) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINX) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).
    ANF-PUMI is a feature that directs incoming calls to a PUM user within the PISN regardless of the PUM user’s geographical location within the PISN, provided that the PUM user’s location is known.
    ANF-PUMO permits the PISN to process call requests from a PUM user at the home location, if required.
    The Q reference point is defined in ECMA-133.
    Service specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ITU-T Rec. I.130. This Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ECMA-283.
    The signalling protocol for ANF-PUMI and ANF-PUMO operates on top of the signalling protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as specified in ECMA-143, and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified in ECMA-165.
    This Standard also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point between ANF-PUMI / ANF-PUMO and other supplementary services and ANFs.
    This Standard is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN.
    The protocol defined in this Standard forms part of the PSS1 protocol (informally known as QSIG).
