    This Ecma Standard specifies the mechanical, physical, and optical characteristics of a 130 mm optical disk cartridge (ODC) that employs thermo-magnetic and magneto-optical effects to enable data interchange between such disks.
    This Ecma Standard specifies two Types, viz.
    Type WO
    provides for data once written to be read a multiplicity of times. Data shall not be erased nor amended. Multisession (incremental write operations) recording may be performed on type WO disks.
    The disk shall be of the same Type if recorded on both sides, A and B. Each side shall have a nominal capacity of 4,58Â Gbytes, irrespective of the Type. The format specifies two sector sizes and allows for emulation of two further sizes.
    This Ecma Standard specifies
    This Ecma Standard provides for interchange between optical disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.
