    This Ecma Standard specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics of 120 mm recordable optical disks with capacities of 8,55 Gbytes and 17,1 Gbytes. It specifies the quality of the recorded and unrecorded signals, the format of the data and the recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange by means of such disks. The data can be written once and read many times using a non-reversible method. These disks are identified as +R DL.
    This Ecma Standard also specifies 80 mm disks with capacities of 2,66 Gbytes and 5,32 Gbytes. These disks shall have the same characteristics as the 120 mm disks, except for some parameters related to the smaller dimensions. All parameters unique for the 80 mm disks are specified in Annex A.
    This Ecma Standard specifies:
    This Ecma Standard provides for the interchange of disks between optical disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.
