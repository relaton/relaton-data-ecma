    This Ecma Standard specifies the mechanical, physical, and optical characteristics of a holographic disk cartridge (HDC) that employs holographic recording to enable data interchange between such disks.
    The disk is of the Phi (Permanent holographic information) type providing for data once written to be read a multiplicity of times.
    The 120 mm diameter disk has a nominal capacity of 200 Gigabytes.
    This Ecma Standard specifies
    This Ecma Standard provides for interchange between holographic disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.
