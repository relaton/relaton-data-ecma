    This Standard specifies a distributed medium access control (MAC) sublayer and a physical layer (PHY) for wireless networks.
    Taken together, the PHY and MAC specified in this Ecma standard are well-suited to high rate, zero infrastructure communications between a mixed population of portable and fixed electronic devices.
    This Ecma specification is not intended to represent the regulatory requirements of any country or region.
    ECMA-368 uses Specifier IDs that are maintained in this Register.
