    This Ecma Standard specifies the mechanical, physical, and optical characteristics of a 130 mm optical disk cartridge (ODC) that employs thermo-optical Phase Change effects to enable data interchange between such disks.
    This Ecma Standard specifies two types, viz.
    The disk shall be two-sided with a nominal capacity of 15,0 Gbytes per side and the cartridge (two sides) shall provide a nominal capacity of 30,0 Gbytes.
    This Ecma Standard specifies:
    This Ecma Standard provides for interchange between optical disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.
