    This Ecma Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of a magnetic tape cartridge, using magnetic tape 12,65Â mm wide, so as to provide physical interchangeability of such cartridges. It also specifies the quality of the recorded signals, the recording method and the recorded format, thereby allowing data interchange between drives by means of such magnetic tape cartridges.
    This Ecma Standard specifies three types of cartridge which, for the purposes of this Standard, are referred to as Type A, Type B and Type C.
    For Type A, the magnetic tape has a nominal length of 91 m and a nominal capacity of 10 GBytes.
    For Type B, the magnetic tape has a nominal length of 204 m and a nominal capacity of 25 GBytes.
    For Type C, the magnetic tape has a nominal length of 392 m and a nominal capacity of 50 GBytes.
    Together with a Standard for Volume and File Structure this Standard provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.
