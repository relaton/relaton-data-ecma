    This Ecma Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of an 8 mm wide magnetic tape cartridge containing a memory chip to enable physical interchange of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of the recorded signals, the recording method and the recorded format – called Advanced Intelligent Tape No.2 with Memory In Cartridge (AIT-2 with MIC) – thereby allowing data interchange between drives by means of such magnetic tape cartridges. The System Log are recorded in the MIC.
    This Ecma Standard specifies two types of cartridge depending on the thickness of the magnetic tape contained in the case.
    Information interchange between systems also requires, at a minimum, agreement between the interchange parties upon the interchange code(s) and the specifications of the structure and labelling of the information on the interchanged cartridge.
    NOTE – Annex D contains the table translating the 16-bit words in 20-channel bit patterns. Due to its size (1681 pages) it is available only as a separated file, and it is not available in printed format.
