    This standard describes a statistical background noise correction by which background noise contributions may be removed from measured noise levels.
    The statistical background noise is an alternative to the legacy background noise correction found in ECMA-74 and ISO 7779, ISO 3741, ISO 3744, ISO 3745, and ISO 11201.
    Background noise corrections are used to obtain the background corrected source level, which is an estimate of the level radiated by the source or device under test. The background corrected source level is obtained by subtracting the background noise correction from the measured noise emission or source level, which contains both source and background contributions.
    Measurement of noise emissions generated by Information Technology and Telecommunications Equipment (ITT) is described in ECMA-74 and ISO 7779.
