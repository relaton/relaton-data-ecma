    This Ecma Standard specifies the characteristics of a case for use with a Read-only Holographic Versatile Disc (HVD-ROM).
    This Ecma Standard specifies
    – the environments in which the case is to be operated and stored;
    – the dimensional and mechanical characteristics of the case, so as to provide mechanical interchangeability between data processing systems.
    This Ecma Standard provides for mechanical interchange between holographic disk drives.
