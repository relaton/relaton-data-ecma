    This Ecma Standard specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Call priority interruption (SS-CPI) and Call Priority Interruption Protection (SS-CPIP) supplementary services at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).
    NOTE 1 – This edition of this Standard does not apply to calls using the circuit-mode multiple rate bearer service.
    SS-CPI allows a call request for a priority call to proceed successfully in the case that there is no user information channel available. This is accomplished by force releasing an established call of lower priority.
    SS-CPIP allows for the protection of calls against interruption from priority calls.
    The Q reference point is defined in ECMA-133.
    Service specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. This Ecma Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ECMA-263.
    The signalling protocol for SS-CPI(P) operates on top of the signalling protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as specified in ECMA-143, and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified in ECMA-165.
    This Standard also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point between SS-CPI(P) and other supplementary services and ANFs.
    NOTE 2 – Additional interactions that have no impact on the signalling protocol at the Q reference point can be found in the relevant stage 1 specifications.
    This Ecma Standard is applicable to PINXs that can interconnect to form a PISN.
    The protocol defined in this Standard forms part of the PSS1 protocol (informally known as QSIG).
